# Doremus Ontology

The [DOREMUS](http://www.doremus.org) ontology represented in OWL, realised on [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/).

It relies on the latest FRBRoo (v2.4) ontology.

> Please note that this version of FRBRoo is not yet published but [Erlangen](http://erlangen-crm.org/) is presently working on it

## Future work

- [ ] Add scope notes and examples
- [ ] Add cardinality
